# Network Automation and Topology Mapping Scripts

This repository contains Python scripts developed during my internship in the Network Operations Center (NOC). The scripts are designed to automate network device management and visualization tasks, including:

- CDP Neighbor Discovery: Automates the retrieval of Cisco CDP neighbor details using Netmiko, updates interface descriptions, and securely saves configurations.
- Network Topology Mapping: Generates Draw.io-compatible XML files to visualize network topologies, ensuring accurate and efficient documentation.
- Data Processing: Cleans and organizes CDP data stored in Excel, removing duplicates and standardizing interface names with custom algorithms.
- Interface Standardization: Applies regex-based transformations to ensure consistent interface naming conventions.



## Key Features:

- Integration with Cisco devices via SSH.
- Excel file handling for data storage and processing.
- Automated generation of network diagrams compatible with Draw.io.
- Robust error handling for secure and reliable automation.

These scripts demonstrate my practical experience in network automation, Python scripting, and DevOps methodologies. Feel free to explore, use, and adapt the code for your projects! Feedback and contributions are welcome.
